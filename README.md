# Week 1 code challenge

# 1 Project Title : gradegenerator
In this code challenge I am to create a program that generates the users grade depending on the input.

# 2 Project Title : speeddetector
In this code challenge I am to create a program that takes speed of the user and returns a valid output depending on the users speed.
If the user is below the speed limit the program returns ok meaning he is not past the speed limit.
If the users speed is above the speed limit which is 70 the program claculates the demerit points and returns to the user as output.
If the demerit points exceed 12 the users lincence is revoked.

# 3 Project Title : salarycalculator
In this code challenge I am to create a program that claculates the net salary of the user.
The program carries out various deduction claculations which are payee tax,NHIF and NSSF.
The program then deducts it from the gross income to get the netsalary.
